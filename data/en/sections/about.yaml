summary: 'I wear many hats. Father, husband, Microsoft MVP, developer, Azure Solutions Architect, gamer, blogger, speaker, teacher, mentor, model railroader, Buckeyes fan, and more. I’ve been blessed greatly by this industry, and so this site is one way I try to give a little bit back. When I can find the time, I add a bit of my coding knowledge and experience to share with whoever might find it of worth.'
